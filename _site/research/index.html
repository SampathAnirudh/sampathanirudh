<p>The overall theme of our research is to understand kinetics, mechanics, and thermodynamics of engineered nanosystems, and to use the observed phenomena for various applications including renewable energy and bioengineering. Our ideas for technological breakthroughs are often inspired by biological processes in nature. Our effort includes design and fabrication of DNA nanostructures from self-assembly, which are integrated with nanocrystals, carbon nanotubes, graphene, and transition metal dichalcogenides. These nanosystems are explored to study energy conversion and transport processes, and to develop novel devices with new levels of system control at the nanoscale. Characterization techniques include absorption, Raman, and photoluminescence spectroscopy ranging from UV to near-infrared, with an emphasis on single molecule/particle imaging and spectroscopy. Additionally, atomic force microscopy and spectro-electrochemistry are methods commonly used in the lab. While we focus on fundamental nanoscience and nanoengineering, we aim to make transformative impacts in our society as well as scientific community.</p>

<p>Here are some themes and techniques that we currently work on:</p>

<p><strong>Atomic Force Microscopy.</strong></p>

<p><strong>DNA Walkers.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Nanofabricated “Smart Tips”</strong>.
<img src="http://localhost:4000/images/respic/SmartTip.png" alt="" style="width: 250px; float: left; margin: 0px  10px" />
One of the  projects back from my job-proposal is to develop nanofabricated STM tips. The idea behind these “smart tips” is to use the technologies that were developed over decades in nanofabrication and make them available for scanning probe by using a nano-device instead of the traditional STM tungsten tip. One gains the flexibility of using different functionalities that are known from the fields of nanofabrication and mesoscopic physics. We are collaborating with the group Simon Groeblacher at TU Delft to realize this concept, benefitting from their unparalleled micro/nano fabrication know how.  A prototype of a smart tip is shown to the left. See publications in Microsyst Nanoeng, Nanotechnology, and PRB.</p>

<p><strong>Josephson STM.</strong> Josephson STM has the ability to gain insight into spatial variations of the order parameter, or superfluid density. We have managed to, for the first time, use JSTM with atomic resolution on a quantum material.
We have used atomic-resolution Josephson scanning tunneling microscopy to reveal a strongly inhomogeneous superfluid in the iron-based superconductor FeTe0.55Se0.45. The results and their implications are published in Nature.</p>

<p>We also detected and investigated a quite particular YSR state in the same material.</p>

<p><strong>Ultra-stable SI-STM instrument.</strong>  <img src="http://localhost:4000/images/respic/STMHead.png" alt="" style="width: 250px; float: right; margin: 0px 10px" />
For SI-STM, having the most stable STM head is key. We have used finite element simulations, good choices in material science, and craftsmanship to build the most stable STM head in the world, to our knowledge. See publication in RSI.</p>

<p><strong>Strange Metals.</strong> The strange metal phase might be the most mysterious phase of high-temperature superconductors. Here, the electrical resistivity grows linearly with temperature T in large areas of the phase diagram, with a mean free path that diminishes to a fraction of the interatomic distance. T-linear resistivity is often associated with quantum critical points and marginal-Fermi-liquid physics. In strange metals, the mystery seems to go even further: we deal with something that looks like a quantum critical phase over an extended range of the phase diagram instead of cumulating in a point. There exists no consistent theory for strange metals, leading to more adventurous new approaches including the holographic theories that use insights from gravity to explain strange metals (a recent textbook on this was written by our colleagues at Leiden University, Schalm and Zaanen).
We are part of the ‘Strange Metal consortium NL’ that includes the groups of Hussey, Golden, van Heumen, Zaanen, Schalm, Stoof and Vandoren. </p>

<p><strong>Magnetic fluctuations and electron spin resonance.</strong>

<p><strong>Twisted bilayer graphene and other material with super-periodicities.</strong>
We have proposed that artificial super-periodicities can lead to improved superconductivity, both because of increased density of states and because of phase space arguments (see image from our SciPost publication below). Perhaps for different reasons, twisted bilayer graphene has been shown to superconduct! We are investigate this material with the groups of Efetov, Baumberger, and van der Molen.</p>
